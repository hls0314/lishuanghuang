I am a third year Ph.d student in [Jinan University](https://www.jnu.edu.cn),and currently visiting in [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de).

My research interests are International Trade and Labor Economics, with two main areas. Firstly, I focus on the effects of trade reform on China's labor market power, including the dynamics of labor migration and wage markdown. Secondly, I focus on how the household policy impact on China's labor force, covering aspects such as skill spillover, the accumulation of human capital, and migration patterns.

I aim to pursue a postdoctoral position in 2025.  You can find my CV here: [Di Qiu's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum Vitae.pdf).

Personal CV
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
