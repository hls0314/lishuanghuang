I am a third year Ph.d student in [Jinan University](https://www.jnu.edu.cn),and currently visiting in [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de).

My research interests are International Trade and Labor Economics, with two main areas. Firstly, I focus on the effects of trade reform on China's labor market power, including the dynamics of labor migration and wage markdown. Secondly, I focus on how the household policy impact on China's labor force, covering aspects such as skill spillover, the accumulation of human capital, and migration patterns.

I aim to pursue a postdoctoral position in 2025.  You can find my CV here: [Lishuang's Curriculum Vitae](lishuanghuang/assets/LishuangHuang_cv2024.pdf).
